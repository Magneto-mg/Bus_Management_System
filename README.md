# Bus_Management_System
# Introduction
Bus management system project focuses mainly on online ticket reservations and route management. It has been made in PHP, Html, CSS and Javascript. The system displays all the lists of available routes according to their prices. In addition, the system allows managing bus information too. 
This project is divided into two categories: Admin, and Customer. 
In an overview of this web application, the role of the customer is pretty simple. A customer can only check the ticket’s status using PNR. Here, the admin has to provide the PNR code. 
As result, the customers can have their bus ticket details such as route, seat, timing, and other information. Besides, all other features; like adding new buses, adding new customers, adding new bus routes and also booking tickets for a customer; fall upon the hands of an administrator.
